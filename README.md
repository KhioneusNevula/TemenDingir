<h2>Gods</h2>
Gods are sentient constructs created through an act of worship. Any person can create one at any time or pledge themself to a god; a player can only have one god. The creator of a god is automatically its High Priest.<br>
To create a god, one must construct an altar of sorts. This altar is four wood stair blocks facing in cardinal directions with a water block in their center. A fence must be placed in the center of the water, and atop this fence a torch must be placed. Upon right clicking the torch with a stick, harmless lightning will strike it, destroying the torch and turning the fence and water into the primordial blue-green water of Apsu and Tiamat. This primordial water will vanish if the stair blocks are removed. Additionally, a special book-and-quill will be given to the player. The first line written in the book and quill will be the name of the god. The book and quill must be tossed into the primordial water.
