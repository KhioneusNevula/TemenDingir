<h1>TEMEN-DINGIR</h1>
Sumerian: "Foundations of the Gods"
<br>
Mod which adds a religion faction system alongside magic powers from the gods
<br>
<h2>Gods</h2>
Gods are sentient constructs created through an act of worship. Any person can create one at any time or pledge themself to a god; a player can only have one god. The creator of a god is automatically its High Priest.<br>
To create a god, one must construct an altar of sorts. This altar is four wood stair blocks facing in cardinal directions with a water block in their center. A fence must be placed in the center of the water, and atop this fence a torch must be placed. Upon right clicking the torch with a stick, harmless lightning will strike it, destroying the torch and turning the fence and water into the primordial blue-green water of Apsu and Tiamat. This primordial water will vanish if the stair blocks are removed. Additionally, a special book-and-quill will be given to the player. The first line written in the book and quill will be the name of the god. The book and quill must be tossed into the primordial water.
After that, three items must be tossed in--these items will represent the "trinity" that invokes the deity. Note that NBT data will be ignored, i.e. a banner tossed in will prime the Invocation to sense ALL banners, not just banners with the given pattern. Once the three items are tossed in (two items can be identical; order doesn't matter; the items will be consumed) the primordial water will vanish.<br>
After this, a Rudimentary god will be born. A Rudimentary is an embryonic god who is not fully born until it is Defined. To Define a god, a new altar must be built, one which is composed of three stone blocks side by side with one raised, and each one having an item frame on one side with an invoker item. The middle block with nothing in it should have a torch on the same side as the item frames. Once this is complete, right click any block in the altar to bring up a specification GUI. Only the High Priest can do this.

<h3>Specification GUI</h3>
The rudimentary god's altar will bring up a gui to specify its religion.
<h4>Pronouns</h4>
These are he/him, she/her, or they/them, and determine the god's form of address
<h4>Tenets</h4>
Tenets follow a system known as "tenet points." Tenets are rules that the faithful follow; to break one is to lose some favor with the god, and for a priest to break one is to lose priesthood. Each tenet is worth a certain amount of points; a minimum of seven tenet points need to be expended, but some tenets are worth more than others since they are more difficult to uphold but also lose less favor if they are broken. A High Priest can add as many tenets to their god as they want; leveling up the god lowers the minimum tenet amount.
<ul>
  <li>No killing passive or neutral mobs (2 pt): Killing a passive mob (directly) loses favor.
    <li>No killing hostile mobs (4 pt): Killing a hostile mob (directly) loses favor.
      <li>Love one another (2 pt): Killing a player of any sort loses favor.
      <li>Love your neighbor (1 pt): Killing another of the same religion loses favor.
      <li>No potioncraft (1 pt): Drinking a potion (willingly) loses favor; being hit by one does not.
        <li>No enchanting (3 pt): Clicking with an enchanted tool or equipping enchanted armor loses favor; for armor, only the initial equip loses favor.
          <li>No cursing (1 pt): Applying a curse to an item loses favor
            <li>No wearing chestgear (5 pt): Equipping a chestgear item causes a loss in favor
              <li>No eating meat (2 pt): Eating a meat consumable that is NOT fish causes a loss in favor.
                <li>No eating crops (3 pt): Eating a plant consumable causes a loss in favor
                  <li>No false idols (1 pt): Construction of an iron or snow golem will cause a loss in favor.
                    </ul>
<h4>Worship Methods</h1>
Similar to tenets, worship system has something called "worship points." Worship is the actions that empower one's god to raise its level and powers; there can only be a maximum of 7 worship points expended (leveling can increase that) and more difficult actions are worth less worship points (to facilitate the variety in worshiping methods) but also give more power to the god. Worship is performed through some action in relation to a Sacred Fire. 
<ul>
  <li>Human sacrifice (1 pt): Sacrifice a villager to the sacred fire, with a higher level and stock being worth more.
    <li>Hostile sacrifice (1 pt): Sacrifice a hostile mob to the sacred fire, with higher health worth more. Player sacrifice is also allowed under this.
      <li>Passive sacrifice (2 pt): Sacrifice an animal to the sacred fire, with higher health worth more.
        <li>Tool sacrifice (3 pt): Sacrifice tools to the sacred fire, with higher tiers and durability worth more.
          <li>Food sacrifice (5 pt): Sacrifice a consumable to the sacred fire, with higher food points worth more.
            <li>Plant sacrifice (6 pt): Sacrifice plant items (flowers, saplings, cacti, vines, logs, and seeds) to the sacred fire.
</ul>
<h4>Worship Conditions</h4>
A minimum of 4 worship condition points must be expended. Worship conditions are conditions that must be met in order for worship to occur successfully. If not, the worship will fail. More difficult conditions are worth more points.
